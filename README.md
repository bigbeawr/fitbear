### Stable Execution:
To execute the project, download the code on the main master branch and unzip the folder. Open Android Studio -> File -> Open, and find the extracted folder (This should have an Android logo on the file). The versions used in this project of Android Studio include: Chipmunk 2021.2.1. The Java JKD used was JDK 11. Any discrepencies may be dependencies not being fully installed or Gradle incompatabilities. 

Any unexpected erros may occur due to emulator discongruency or depreciated imports. (Emulators used in debugging are sdkgphone x86 arm (mobile) and Android Emulator Pixel 5 API 33) Please use the ones discribed below and their specific versions. This should be imported directly by default on compilation of the app. Additional information about dependencies located below. The application does not require any locations permissions, camera permissions, or any others. 


### Additional Resources:

Our application was heavily inspired by the recent surge in unhealthy eating habits and indulgence in sedentary lifestyles. According to studies, about 50 percent of males and 75 percent of females in the UAE live sedentary lifestyles thus contributing to obesity and disorders. This, to combat this, our team sought to develop a personalized and versatile solution to motivate users to maintain a healthier daily routine based on their own accords. As for the physical application, our design was heavily inspired by the minimalistic Instagram-like UI which was modern and seemed to appeal to teens, a major population who is effected by unhealthy habits.

Fitbear is an Android application that allows users to set goals for daily calorie, protein, and carbohydrate intake. It further allows users to track their weight on a weekly basis and monitor their workouts. Ultimately, our team had an great time developing such a meaningful application and sharing a memorable opportunity. We found great joy taking advantage of each others’ strengths and developing each others’ weaknesses. We truly hope to revisit this project as we see it’s potential to be extended into a truly revolutionary tool.
